/**
 * @fileoverview Per-room in-memory tape of replay preambles, keyed by commit seq.
 *
 * The stroke fingerprint log (`shared/StrokeFingerprint.js`) stores only the
 * bytes of *commit* messages (MU/FILL/SEL_COMMIT/…). A commit like MU is just a
 * marker — a brush stroke's actual geometry travels in the non-committed MM
 * stream, and its appearance depends on the user's tool state (tool/color/size),
 * which may have been set by a CT/CC/CS that predates the checkpoint. So commit
 * bytes alone cannot reconstruct a brush stroke for a *fresh joiner* who never
 * saw the live MM/tool-state chatter.
 *
 * This tape closes that gap. For each stroke it retains a **self-contained
 * preamble**: a snapshot of the user's latest tool-state frames (captured as
 * they flow) followed by the MD and every MM frame, all keyed by the seq the
 * server assigns to that stroke's commit. On join, replaying a tape bundle
 * (preamble frames) followed by the commit bytes (from the fingerprint log)
 * lets the joiner draw the stroke itself through the normal pipeline — no
 * rendered pixels, no new client draw code.
 *
 * A few non-stroke commits also need preambles: FILL/IMG_PASTE depend on the
 * user's current tool state, and selection commits depend on non-commit setup
 * frames such as SEL_LIFT/SEL_MOVE. Those lightweight dependencies are retained
 * here too, under the commit seq that consumes them.
 *
 * Bounding: checkpoint truncation (`truncateBefore`, mirrors the fingerprint
 * log) is the primary bound; a count cap is a backstop. Stored byte arrays must
 * be copies — the encoder reuses its output buffer between messages. Image-tool
 * payloads (brush/pattern/confetti bitmaps) are the one exception to "bundles
 * own their bytes": they are held once in a byte-budgeted store and referenced
 * by handle, so switching brushes in a loop cannot grow the tape without limit,
 * and one brush used by a thousand strokes is stored once. TapeFrameFilter (end
 * of this file) collapses the repeats again on the wire.
