/**
 * @fileoverview Hardened erase masks for selection clear/cut/move.
 *
 * A selection erase is a `destination-out` stroke: the shape is painted white
 * into the stroke canvas and that canvas' ALPHA is what gets subtracted at
 * composite time. Canvas antialiases every non-pixel-aligned edge, so an edge
 * pixel covered `a` of the way through is painted at alpha `a` — and
 * destination-out then leaves `a·(1−a)` of the original colour behind. At the
 * worst (a = 0.5) a quarter of the pixel survives.
 *
 * On its own that is invisible, but Fill paints the SAME antialiased shape, so
 * filling a selection and clearing it leaves a faint outline of the fill
 * colour tracing the selection. Cut and move leave the same rim.
 *
 * The fix is to erase a hardened mask: any pixel the shape touched at all goes
 * to full alpha before it is used as the erase source, so the erase removes
 * exactly the pixels the matching fill could have painted. Hardening is done by
 * compositing the mask onto itself — each pass takes alpha `a` to `a·(2−a)`,
 * which converges on 1 for every non-zero coverage and leaves untouched pixels
 * at 0. That keeps it a handful of GPU blits with no `getImageData` readback of
 * a potentially board-sized region.
 */

/**
 * Passes of self-compositing. Alpha per pass: a → a·(2−a). Ordinary antialiased
 * edges (a ≈ 0.2–0.8) saturate in about five; 1/255, the faintest coverage an
 * 8-bit backing store can even hold, needs eleven. Twelve covers everything
 * with headroom and is still only twelve blits of the selection.
