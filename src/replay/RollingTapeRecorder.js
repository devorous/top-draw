/**
 * @fileoverview Rolling "DVR" tape recorder.
 *
 * Unlike the manual {@link Recorder} (toggled by the topbar tape button, records
 * an open-ended session and exports `.ddraw`), this recorder runs automatically
 * in the background once a room has synced and keeps only a bounded window of
 * recent activity — roughly the last two minutes. Opening History → "Recent"
 * freezes the current window into an immutable {@link ReplayRecording} and hands
 * it to `TimeMachine.loadFromRecording()` while the live recorder keeps going.
 *
 * It is built on the exact same `ReplayRecording` shape the manual recorder and
 * TimeMachine already consume, so the scrubber, visual-checkpoint preview grid,
 * `.ddraw` export and parity harness all work unchanged.
 *
 * Pruning is checkpoint-aware (see {@link RollingTapeRecorder._prune}): we never
 * drop deltas without keeping a base checkpoint at or before the oldest visible
 * timestamp, otherwise the frozen tape would have nothing to replay from.

   * present can scrub back through what was just drawn. The server keeps that
   * window (server/RoomHistory.js) and streams it here after SYNC_COMPLETE.
   *
   * The frames are the same wire messages a live peer recorded, so they compose
   * exactly like locally-captured deltas; the only difference is where the base
   * image comes from. That base is a checkpoint IMAGE, not a captured layer

   * anchor's snapshot purely so the tape has a valid base object; the restore
   * delta immediately overwrites its pixels.
   *
   * Timing is real, with one fallback. The server stamps every frame with its
   * own arrival time (StrokeTape's parallel timestamp track), so a stroke's
   * MD/MM frames unfold at the rate they were drawn and hover moves between
   * strokes play at their true spacing; gaps go through the same
   * IDLE_LEADOUT_MS dead-air compression the live clock uses. Frames that
   * genuinely share an instant — the tool-state snapshot at mousedown,
   * selection setup before a commit — are spread at BACKFILL_FRAME_TICK_MS so
   * they cannot stack on one timestamp, capped so they never run into whatever
   * comes next.
   *
   * Frames arrive in SEQ order, which is not always TS order: another user's
   * hover during someone's stroke is sequenced before that stroke's commit but
   * happened during it. The clock below only ever moves forward, so such a
   * frame costs no time rather than rewinding the tape.
